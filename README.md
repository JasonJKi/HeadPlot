# Motivation
HeadPlot has been deconstructed from the popular topoplot.m from EEGLab by Schwartz Lab at UCSD. 
The original code has been cleaned up and refactored for readability and organization. Headplot aims to be user friendly, easy to use
plot tool for both researchers and developers. It has decluttered and stripped of all unnecessary dependencies required to use topoplot.m
